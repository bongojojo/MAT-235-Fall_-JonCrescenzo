Jon Crescenzo's Respository for Class


Hi I am Jon. I have a background in communications, political science, philosophy and art. 

I have worked in film, large scale print production and marketing for over a decade. My longest job was at Uni of Pennsylvania, where I worked in educational research for about 8 years. 

I like to swim and bike. I may work out a lot but I eat horribly. 


I do not like sportsball, but I love Philly and our sports teams.
